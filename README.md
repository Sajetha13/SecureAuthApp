# Secure Auth App

A minimal authentication system using Firebase, built as a learning project.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how I learned to implement a simple authentication system using Firebase. It includes a login and signup system, a dashboard, and basic security warnings.

## Features

- Firebase Authentication (Email & Password)
- Simple and functional UI
- Login and Signup system
- A minimal dashboard with logout functionality

## Live Demo

[Your Vercel Deployment Link]

##  Technology Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – Frontend  
- **Firebase Authentication** – Backend authentication  
- **Vercel** – Hosting  

## How It Works

1. Users can sign up with an email and password.
2. Once signed in, they are redirected to the dashboard.
3. The dashboard displays the logged-in user’s email and a logout button.
4. Clicking logout ends the session and returns the user to the login page.
